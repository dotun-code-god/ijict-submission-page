        - Individual
            - redirects them to fellowhub.com/onboarding/individual
        - Fellowship

- Authentication
    - On completion of the onboarding process, a link would be sent to their mail which would include the subdomain of the fellowship they have joined, for example, 
      someone who just joined dlcfoau would be redirected to dlcfoau.fellowhub.com/auth/login where they enter their email and password, and the system intelligently query that 
      data for dlcfoau alone
